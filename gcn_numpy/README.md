# Overview
This directory hosts the code behind two YouTube videos from the WelcomeAIOverlords channel.

## Message Passing on Graphs
The [message_passing.ipynb](./message_passing.ipynb) notebook was used to generate the message passing "water drop" example in the [video](https://youtu.be/ijmxpItkRjc) that explains the connection between the adjacency matrix and message passing algorithms.

## Graph Convolutional Networks in NumPy
The [gcn_from_scratch.ipynb](./gcn_from_scratch.ipynb) notebook was used to implement Graph Convolutional Networks from scratch using NumPy in [this video](https://youtu.be/8qTnNXdkF1Q).
