# Overview
This directory hosts the code used to generate the [An Example of Graph Convolutional Networks](https://blog.zakjost.com/post/gcn_citeseer/) blog post.  It uses [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/) (DGL) and its built-in CiteSeer citation network dataset to explore the behavior of Graph Convolutional Networks under a variety of settings.  

# Requirements
See the example [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for versions of some selected packages I used.  Please note that this isn't meant to be a complete `requirements.txt`, but rather a reference for the libraries that are fundamental to this study.
