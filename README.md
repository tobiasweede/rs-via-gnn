# RS via GNN

## Overview
This repository contains experiment code for the 
master thesis ***Recommender Systems via Graph Neural Networks***.

We address:
* Fundamental proof of concept for the _Message Passing_ paradigm.
* MLN baselines
* GNN experiments

## Environment / Installation
It is suggested to use a dedicated python instance.
We used conda and the installed packages can be found in `environment.yml`.
See https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file for further instructions.

## Credits
For our experiments we heavily rely on other people's work.
We thank everyone who made her research and code publicly available.
The original sources are marked in the individual files.
